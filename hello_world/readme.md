#First program

this program holds little to no interest, this was done in order to do an assembly program in arm, coming from an x86 background.

Though i learnt

In ARM, syscall are put in r7, the return is in r0 and args are passed in r0-r1-r2-r3-r4 and r5.


For the syscall numbers i refered to https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/constants/syscalls.md#arm-32_bit_eabi
